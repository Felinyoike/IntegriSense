## Features

- **Portable & User-Friendly:** Compact hardware design for field and office use.
- **Multi-Biometric Analysis:** Integrates heart rate, skin conductance, and other physiological signals.
- **AI/ML-Powered:** Utilizes machine learning models for real-time signal analysis and deception detection.
- **Modular Architecture:** Easily extensible for new sensors or analytic methods.
- **Ethical & Transparent:** Designed with privacy, consent, and responsible AI use in mind.

## How It Works

1. **Data Acquisition:** Portable sensors collect biometric signals from the subject.
2. **Signal Processing:** Raw data is preprocessed and cleaned.
3. **Feature Extraction:** Key features indicative of physiological arousal are extracted.
4. **AI/ML Analysis:** Machine learning models evaluate the extracted features to assess the likelihood of deception.
5. **Reporting:** Results are presented in a clear, actionable format for professionals.
