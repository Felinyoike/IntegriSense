## How can I edit this code?

There are several ways of editing your application.

**Use Lovable**

Simply visit the [Lovable Project](https://lovable.dev/projects/aed329fd-f049-4924-bc84-b5aad92e259c) and start prompting.

Changes made via Lovable will be committed automatically to this repo.

**Use your preferred IDE**

If you want to work locally using your own IDE, you can clone this repo and push changes. Pushed changes will also be reflected in Lovable.

The only requirement is having Node.js & npm installed - [install with nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating)

Follow these steps:

```sh
# Step 1: Clone the repository using the project's Git URL.
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>

# Step 2: Navigate to the project directory.
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>

# Step 3: Install the necessary dependencies.
npm i

# Step 4: Start the development server with auto-reloading and an instant preview.
npm run dev
```

**Edit a file directly in GitHub**

- Navigate to the desired file(s).
- Click the "Edit" button (pencil icon) at the top right of the file view.
- Make your changes and commit the changes.

**Use GitHub Codespaces**

- Navigate to the main page of your repository.
- Click on the "Code" button (green button) near the top right.
- Select the "Codespaces" tab.
- Click on "New codespace" to launch a new Codespace environment.
- Edit files directly within the Codespace and commit and push your changes once you're done.

# IntegriSense

**IntegriSense** is a portable, AI-powered deception detection system. It leverages real-time biometric signals—such as heart rate, skin conductance, and more—analyzed by advanced machine learning models to assist professionals in identifying potential deception. Designed for portability, reliability, and ethical use, IntegriSense is targeted at professionals who require objective, data-driven support in critical decision-making environments.

## Overview

IntegriSense combines biometric data acquisition hardware with robust AI/ML algorithms to deliver a real-time assessment of potential deception. Our mission is to provide professionals—such as security personnel, investigators, and interviewers—with an additional, unbiased tool for evaluating truthfulness.

---

## Features

- **Portable & User-Friendly:** Compact hardware design for field and office use.
- **Multi-Biometric Analysis:** Integrates heart rate, skin conductance, and other physiological signals.
- **AI/ML-Powered:** Utilizes machine learning models for real-time signal analysis and deception detection.
- **Modular Architecture:** Easily extensible for new sensors or analytic methods.
- **Ethical & Transparent:** Designed with privacy, consent, and responsible AI use in mind.

---

## How It Works

1. **Data Acquisition:** Portable sensors collect biometric signals from the subject.
2. **Signal Processing:** Raw data is preprocessed and cleaned.
3. **Feature Extraction:** Key features indicative of physiological arousal are extracted.
4. **AI/ML Analysis:** Machine learning models evaluate the extracted features to assess the likelihood of deception.
5. **Reporting:** Results are presented in a clear, actionable format for professionals.

---

## Use Cases

- **Security Screening**
- **Investigative Interviews**
- **Corporate Compliance**
- **Research in Behavioral Science**

---

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Felinyoike/IntegriSense.git
